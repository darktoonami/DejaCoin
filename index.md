## Welcome to Deja Coin
Deja Coin is a peer-to-peer digital currency used to send money online in the advent of a Deja Vu event. Deja Vu events can be tracked in real time, simply buy one Deja coin per deja vu event. Deja vu events are posted onto the ledger, and are moderated by a select team.  With the advent of CERN and time-travel, keeping track of timeline shifts has proven to be a real problem. Deja Coin aims to solve this using the blockchain ledger.

So say for instance X Political event occurs, then X Political is placed onto the ledger. Buying into that event then ascertained you apart of that timeline. So, if it were to shift and reality no longer correlated to exactly what you buy into at that event, you would know you have shifted timelines.  Certain issues to address include supply amount (are timeline shifts potentially infinite?) As well as decimal percentages (can you have a partial Mandela effect etc). The snake on the logo itself is indicative of the Great Snake of Time, who has dissolved due to timeline shifts. The broken replay button inside of one of the wheels of the snake represents dejavu as well.
